## üõ† Technology Stack & Design Choices

This project aims for a high-performance, personalized user experience, integrating AI and social features, with considerations for future mobile expansion. The technology stack reflects these goals:

### Core Stack

*   **Backend Language:** **Go (Golang)**
    *   *Why:* Chosen for its excellent performance, concurrency handling, static typing, and suitability for building robust APIs (both HTTP and gRPC).

*   **Backend Framework/Router:** **Chi** or **Gin Gonic**
    *   *Why:* Lightweight, high-performance HTTP routers/micro-frameworks for Go, well-suited for building the primary API layer. (See API Layer section below).

*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** with **PostGIS** extension
    *   *Why:* Powerful relational database combined with robust geospatial capabilities (PostGIS) essential for location-based queries (finding nearby points of interest, calculating distances).

*   **Database Interaction (Go):** **`pgx`** (recommended) or `sqlc`
    *   *Why:* `pgx` offers high performance and better type handling compared to the standard `database/sql` for PostgreSQL. `sqlc` can generate type-safe Go code from SQL queries, reducing boilerplate.

*   **Frontend Framework:** **SvelteKit** or **Next.js (React)**
    *   *Why:* Both are modern, powerful frameworks offering Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) capabilities. **SSR is crucial for SEO** and can improve perceived performance (faster first contentful paint). The choice depends on team preference (Svelte vs. React). Using **Tanstack Query (React Query) / Svelte Query** is recommended for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management on the frontend.

*   **Maps (Frontend):** **Mapbox GL JS**, **MapLibre GL JS**, or **Leaflet** (potentially **CesiumJS** for advanced 3D)
    *   *Why:* Provide interactive map experiences. Mapbox/MapLibre offer excellent performance and customization (including 3D potential). Leaflet is simpler for basic 2D maps. This is primarily a frontend implementation detail, consuming location data from the backend API.

*   **AI Engine Integration:** **Direct Google Gemini API via `google/generative-ai-go`**
    *   *Why:* To leverage the latest models (like Gemini 1.5 Pro with its large context window) directly for maximum control and capability. This allows feeding rich contextual information (user profile, time, location, *data fetched from PostGIS about nearby POIs*) into the prompt for deeply personalized recommendations. Using the official Go SDK avoids reliance on third-party gateways (like MCP), potential model availability lag, and potentially extra costs, while giving full control over prompt engineering.

*   **Authentication:** **Standard JWT + `Goth` package**
    *   *Why:* JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user sessions via the API. Goth provides a straightforward way to integrate multiple social media logins (Google, Facebook, etc.) on the backend.

### API Layer: HTTP vs. gRPC

*   **Decision:** Start with a primary **HTTP/REST API** (using Chi or Gin).
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Frontend Simplicity:** Standard HTTP/REST APIs are significantly easier to consume directly from web frameworks (SvelteKit, Next.js/React) using the native Fetch API or libraries like Axios/Tanstack Query, simplifying frontend development and debugging.
    *   **Performance:** While gRPC offers potential performance benefits (binary protocol, multiplexing), a well-designed Go HTTP API with efficient database queries, appropriate caching, and potentially HTTP/2 support is typically **performant enough** for this type of application's initial needs. Performance bottlenecks are often in database access or complex business logic, not necessarily the HTTP transport itself.
    *   **Ecosystem & Tooling:** The ecosystem for HTTP APIs, including testing tools (like Postman/Insomnia), browser debugging, and standard libraries, is more mature and widely understood for web development.
    *   **Third-Party Integrations:** Social sharing and other external services often rely on standard HTTP callbacks or webhooks.
    *   **gRPC Complexity:** Implementing gRPC for direct browser communication requires gRPC-Web proxies (like Envoy or the built-in Go proxy) or specific frontend libraries, adding setup and operational complexity.
*   **Future Consideration:** gRPC *could* be introduced later for specific backend-to-backend communication between microservices if the architecture evolves that way, or if profiling identifies the HTTP API layer itself as a critical performance bottleneck for specific high-throughput operations. However, starting with HTTP simplifies the initial development and frontend integration significantly.

### Social Features

*   **Sharing:** The backend API will provide endpoints to fetch POI details. The frontend will implement sharing functionality using standard web share APIs or direct links formatted for WhatsApp, Discord, etc.
*   **Login:** Handled by the Go backend using the `Goth` library integrating with the chosen frontend framework's authentication flow.

### Mobile / Cross-Platform

*   **Strategy:** Build the web application (PWA potentially) first using SvelteKit or Next.js.
*   **Future:** If native mobile apps are required:
    *   If using **Next.js/React**, **React Native** (potentially with shared components/logic via React Native Web) offers a path to target iOS, Android, and Web with significant code reuse, all consuming the same backend API.
    *   If using **SvelteKit**, options include Capacitor/Ionic for wrapping the web app or building native apps separately (Swift/Kotlin) consuming the API.

### Summary

This stack prioritizes **performance** (Go, PostGIS, efficient API), **personalization** (direct Gemini 1.5 integration via `go-genai`), **SEO** (SSR via SvelteKit/Next.js), and **developer experience**. Starting with an HTTP API simplifies frontend integration while retaining the option to introduce gRPC later if needed. The chosen components provide a solid foundation for current features and future expansion into mobile and enhanced social integration.
