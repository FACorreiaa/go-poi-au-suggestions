Make a view that will be on the tab called.. Recents. That view should be similar to discover but instead of getting data from the LLM, it will show data from the cities that are already saved on the database. Recents should have all the previous interactions the user did. Either on the input, on the chat or on the discover. If it needs a new handler and service, build it. 
the llm_interactions saves the city name and somewhere on my server there should be possible to get the points of interest checked for each interaction
