This is a fantastic set of logs! You've captured the exact behavior of both the standard and streaming endpoints, which shows a clear pattern.

**The core problem is a timeout.** Your LLM call is taking a long time (~11 seconds in the first log), and either the client (Insomnia) or a proxy/server in between is giving up before the full response can be sent back.

Let's break down the clues from both logs:

---

### **Analysis of the Normal (Non-Streaming) Endpoint Log**

```
5:01PM INF logger/logger.go:40 Request completed ... status=200 ... latency=11.432184833s
5:01PM ERR api/utils.go:56 Failed to write response body error="write tcp 127.0.0.1:8000->127.0.0.1:60896: i/o timeout"
```

1.  **Everything in your Go application worked perfectly!**
    *   `Detected domain=itinerary` -> Correct.
    *   `Fetched interests ... Fetched profiles ... Fetched tags` -> Correct.
    *   `parsePOIsFromResponse: Parsed as unified chat response poiCount=9` -> **Success!** Your code correctly parsed the large JSON response from the LLM.
    *   `Saved unified chat LLM interaction` -> The database write was successful.
    *   `Request completed ... status=200` -> Your handler's logic finished and it *tried* to send a `200 OK` status.

2.  **The Failure Point:**
    *   `ERR api/utils.go:56 Failed to write response body error="write tcp ... i/o timeout"`
    *   This is the smoking gun. Your `api.WriteJSONResponse` function started to write the large JSON response back to the client, but the connection was closed by the client (or a timeout was hit) before it could finish.

3.  **The Client's Perspective:**
    *   The Insomnia client shows `Error: Server returned nothing (no headers, no data)`.
    *   This is because its internal timeout (likely 10 seconds by default) was reached. It waited 10 seconds, got nothing, and closed the connection. A second later, your server tried to write to this now-closed connection, resulting in the "i/o timeout" error on the server side.

**Conclusion for Non-Streaming:** The entire process is simply taking too long for a standard HTTP request-response cycle. An 11-second API call is not a good user experience and is prone to timeouts.

### **Analysis of the Streaming Endpoint Log**

This log is even more revealing.

```
5:01PM ERR chat_prompt/chat_service_stream.go:41 Unprocessed event sent to dead letter queue event="{Type:parsing_response ...}"
5:01PM ERR chat_prompt/chat_service.go:4103 Failed to save unified chat stream LLM interaction error="failed to start transaction: context canceled"
5:01PM WRN chat_prompt/chat_service_stream.go:56 Context cancelled, not sending stream event eventType=error
5:01PM WRN chat_prompt/chat_service_stream.go:56 Context cancelled, not sending stream event eventType=complete
```

1.  **What's Happening:** The `context.Context` is being canceled. In a web server, the context is tied to the lifecycle of the incoming HTTP request. When the client (Insomnia) disconnects (due to its own timeout), the server's HTTP handler cancels the context to clean up resources and stop work that is no longer needed.

2.  **The Sequence of Events:**
    *   Your streaming worker starts.
    *   It successfully calls the LLM, which starts streaming back the large JSON response. Your code correctly sends `partial_response` events.
    *   The LLM finishes generating the full text (`rawResponseText`).
    *   Your code sends the `parsing_response` event to the `eventCh`. This gets sent to the dead-letter queue because the channel is likely no longer being listened to (the client has disconnected).
    *   The code then tries to save the interaction: `l.llmInteractionRepo.SaveInteraction(ctx, interaction)`.
    *   Inside `SaveInteraction`, it calls `r.pgpool.BeginTx(ctx, pgx.TxOptions{})`.
    *   By this point, the client has timed out and disconnected. The Go HTTP server cancels the request's `ctx`.
    *   The `BeginTx` call immediately fails with `context canceled`.
    *   The rest of your `go func()` in the streaming service sees the context is canceled and tries to send `error` and `complete` events, which also go to the dead-letter queue.

**Conclusion for Streaming:** The same root cause (client timeout) is happening, but it manifests as a `context canceled` error on the server because the server is designed to react to the client's disconnection.

### **The Solution: Embrace Streaming Fully (and an easier frontend path)**

Your unified prompt is a great idea, but making the LLM generate a single, massive JSON blob defeats the primary purpose of streaming: **getting initial data to the user FAST.**

The core issue isn't the single endpoint vs. multiple, it's the **single prompt vs. multiple, sequential prompts.**

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Would it be easier to have two inputs on the frontend?**
    **YES, ABSOLUTELY.** This is the simplest and most robust fix.
    *   **UI:** Have one input for "City" (e.g., "Barcelona") and another for "What are you looking for?" (e.g., "walk", "restaurants").
    *   **Backend:** Your handler now receives a structured request: `{ "city": "Barcelona", "message": "walk" }`.
    *   **Benefit:** You completely **eliminate the need for the `extractCityFromMessage` LLM call**. This saves you time, money, and a point of failure. You immediately know the city and the user's intent.

2.  **Refactor Your Service to be Truly Sequential and Streamable:**
    Instead of one giant prompt, break the process down into smaller, streamable steps.

    **Revised Streaming Flow (`ProcessUnifiedChatMessageStream`):**
    ```go
    go func() {
        defer close(eventCh)

        // START (You already do this)
        l.sendEvent(ctx, eventCh, types.StreamEvent{ Type: types.EventTypeStart, ... })

        // STEP 1: GENERATE CITY DATA (A SMALL, FAST LLM CALL)
        // Send a progress event
        l.sendEvent(ctx, eventCh, types.StreamEvent{ Type: types.EventTypeProgress, Data: "Getting city info..."})
        // Use a specific, fast prompt to get just the general_city_data
        cityData, err := l.generateCityData(ctx, cityName)
        if err != nil { /* handle error */ return }
        // STREAM the city data back to the client immediately.
        l.sendEvent(ctx, eventCh, types.StreamEvent{ Type: types.EventTypeCityData, Data: cityData })
        // The UI can now render the city description while the next step runs.
        
        // STEP 2: DETECT DOMAIN & GET USER PREFS (You already do this)
        domain := domainDetector.DetectDomain(ctx, cleanedMessage)
        searchProfile, ... := l.FetchUserData(...)
        
        // STEP 3: RUN RAG (A FAST DATABASE QUERY)
        l.sendEvent(ctx, eventCh, types.StreamEvent{ Type: types.EventTypeProgress, Data: "Finding relevant places..."})
        semanticPOIs, err := l.enhancePOIRecommendationsWithSemantics(...)
        if err != nil { /* handle error */ }
        // You can even stream back the names of the POIs found so far.

        // STEP 4: GENERATE THE FINAL ITINERARY (THE SLOW LLM CALL)
        // Now build the big prompt, augmented with the RAG context.
        l.sendEvent(ctx, eventCh, types.StreamEvent{ Type: types.EventTypeProgress, Data: "Building your personalized plan..."})
        prompt := l.getPersonalizedPOIWithSemanticContext(...) // Your RAG-enabled prompt
        
        // Use the LLM's streaming API to generate the final itinerary.
        iter, err := l.aiClient.GenerateContentStream(...)
        if err == nil {
            // As chunks of the final JSON come in, send them to the client.
            for resp, err := range iter {
                // ... your existing streaming loop ...
                l.sendEvent(ctx, eventCh, types.StreamEvent{Type: "itinerary_chunk", Data: chunkText})
            }
        }
        
        // COMPLETE
        l.sendEvent(ctx, eventCh, types.StreamEvent{ Type: types.EventTypeComplete, ... })
    }()
    ```

**Why This is Better:**

*   **Fast Time-to-First-Byte:** The user sees *something* (the city description) in 1-2 seconds, not after 11 seconds of waiting. This feels infinitely more responsive.
*   **Avoids Timeouts:** By sending data back to the client in small chunks, you keep the HTTP connection alive. The client's 10-second timeout won't be triggered.
*   **Breaks Down the Problem:** It's easier to debug and optimize each small step (city generation, RAG, itinerary generation) than one monolithic call.
*   **Cost-Savings:** Your `extractCityFromMessage` LLM call is an extra, unnecessary cost that is completely removed by having a dedicated "City" input on the frontend.

**Conclusion:**

Your unified workflow is a great concept, but its implementation as a single, long-running LLM call is causing the timeouts.

1.  **Strongly Recommended:** Change the frontend to have **two separate inputs** for "City" and "Message". This is the simplest, most reliable fix.
2.  **Refactor your streaming service** to perform multiple, smaller steps, and stream the results of each step back to the client as soon as they are ready. Don't wait for everything to finish before sending the first byte of data.
