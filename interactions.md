You've got a fantastic, well-thought-out project here! The feature set is rich, the tech stack choices are solid, and your database schema design is quite comprehensive.

Let's address your core question: **Would `go-genai` be enough for this task, or should you think about an MPC server or a proper AI agent?**

**Short Answer:**

Yes, **`go-genai` used intelligently within your Go backend is absolutely capable and likely the best starting point for the tasks you've described.** You likely do **not** need a separate "MPC server" (Multi-Party Computation is for different kinds of problems) or a complex, standalone "AI agent" framework *initially*. Your Go backend, using `go-genai`, will effectively act as the orchestrator or "agent" for interacting with Gemini.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**1. Why `go-genai` is a Strong Choice Here:**

*   **Direct Gemini Access:** You get direct access to the capabilities of Gemini models (like 1.5 Pro with its large context window and advanced function calling). This is powerful.
*   **Function Calling is Key:** This is crucial for your use case.
    *   **For Coordinates:** You can define a function (e.g., `get_poi_coordinates_and_basic_info`) that your Go backend implements. When Gemini plans an itinerary and decides on a POI, it can "call" this function. Your Go code then queries PostGIS for the POI's name, exact coordinates, address, etc., and returns this structured data to Gemini. Gemini then uses this in its final response or for further planning.
    *   **For Text/History:** Similarly, you can have functions like `get_poi_detailed_description` or `get_historical_context_for_poi`. Gemini requests this, your Go backend fetches it (from your DB or another source if you have detailed pre-compiled text), and returns it.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Structured Output:** You can instruct Gemini to format parts of its output in a specific way (e.g., "For each POI in the itinerary, provide: Name, Coordinates (lat, lon), Brief Description (1-2 sentences), Detailed History (1 paragraph)."). Your Go backend can then parse this structured text.
*   **Control within Your Go Backend:** You maintain full control over the logic. Your Go application will:
    1.  Receive the user request (city, preferences, time).
    2.  Potentially pre-filter candidate POIs from your PostGIS database based on location, basic categories, and opening hours (to give Gemini a more relevant, smaller set of options to work with).
    3.  Construct a detailed prompt for Gemini, including user preferences, the city, time constraints, the list of candidate POIs (with their IDs or basic info), and the available functions Gemini can call (like `get_poi_coordinates_and_basic_info`, `get_poi_detailed_description`).
    4.  Send the request via `go-genai`.
    5.  Handle any function calls Gemini makes: execute the local Go function (which queries your DB), and send the results back to Gemini.
    6.  Receive the final response from Gemini.
    7.  Parse Gemini's response: extract coordinates for the map, textual descriptions for display, and potentially the overall itinerary structure.
    8.  Save relevant data (like the generated itinerary, user feedback, or the `llm_interactions` log) to your PostgreSQL database.

**2. Addressing the "Lot of Text" Problem:**

*   **Multi-Turn or Chained Prompts:** If a single prompt/response becomes too unwieldy or if you need to refine parts of the itinerary, your Go backend can orchestrate multiple calls to Gemini.
    *   **Step 1 (High-Level Plan):** "Generate a 3-hour itinerary for a user interested in 'history' and 'art' in Paris, suggesting 3-4 key POIs."
    *   **Step 2 (Detail for Each POI):** For each POI suggested in Step 1, make a separate call: "Provide the exact coordinates, a detailed historical description, and opening hours for [POI Name from Step 1]." (Or use function calling here).
*   **Specific Output Formatting:** Request specific formats. Instead of just "a lot of text," ask for:
    ```
    "Please provide the itinerary in the following JSON format:
    {
      "itinerary_title": "...",
      "total_duration_estimate": "...",
      "points_of_interest": [
        {
          "name": "...",
          "coordinates": {"lat": ..., "lon": ...},
          "description_short": "...",
          "description_long_history": "...",
          "estimated_visit_time": "..."
        },
        // ... more POIs
      ]
    }
    If you need more details for a POI to fill this, use the provided functions."
    ```
    Your Go backend can then parse this JSON.

**3. MPC Server (Multi-Party Computation):**

*   This is likely not what you need. MPC is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
*   Examples: Secure voting, private data aggregation for medical research.
*   For WanderWiseAI, user preferences and POI data are not typically in a state requiring this kind of complex cryptographic privacy for the core recommendation task. Standard data protection and privacy measures for user data are important, but MPC is a specialized tool for a different problem set.

**4. "Proper AI Agent" (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or building a custom one):**

*   **You are essentially building an AI agent with your Go backend + `go-genai`.**
*   Frameworks like LangChain (primarily Python, though Go equivalents are emerging) provide abstractions and tools to make building complex LLM-powered applications easier. They offer:
    *   **Chains:** Sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities.
    *   **Agents:** LLMs that use tools (like your database query functions).
    *   **Memory:** Ways to persist state across conversations.
    *   **Indexers/Retrievers:** For fetching data to inject into prompts (e.g., from vector databases).
*   **When to consider a more formal "Agent Framework":**
    *   If your logic becomes *extremely* complex with many chained steps, dynamic tool selection, and sophisticated memory management.
    *   If you want to leverage a large ecosystem of pre-built tools and integrations (though this is more common in Python frameworks).
    *   If you find yourself re-implementing many common agentic patterns from scratch.
*   **For now, starting with your Go backend orchestrating `go-genai` calls is a very reasonable and powerful approach.** You can build sophisticated chains and tool use directly in Go. If complexity explodes, you can then evaluate if a dedicated agent framework (either a Go-native one or a separate Python microservice for the agent logic) would simplify things.

**5. Database Schema:**

Your database schema (`llm_interactions`, `cities`, `points_of_interest`) is very well-designed and perfectly suited for this application.

*   `llm_interactions`: Excellent for logging, debugging, and future analysis/fine-tuning. Storing `request_payload` and `response_payload` as `JSONB` is smart.
*   `cities`: Good structure. The `embedding` field is forward-thinking for semantic city search/similarity.
*   `points_of_interest`: Very comprehensive.
    *   `GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)` is correct for PostGIS.
    *   `opening_hours JSONB` is flexible.
    *   `source`, `source_id`, `is_verified`, `is_sponsored` are great for data quality and business logic.
    *   `embedding VECTOR(768)` using `pgvector` is the right way to handle semantic search for POIs.
    *   The indexes are generally good. For `idx_poi_embedding_hnsw`, ensure you have `pgvector` installed and choose the appropriate ops class (e.g., `vector_cosine_ops`, `vector_l2_ops`, `vector_ip_ops`) based on how your embeddings are generated and how you want to measure similarity.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Proceed with `go-genai` within your Go backend.** Focus on:
    *   Designing clear Go functions that Gemini can call (for DB queries, etc.).
    *   Crafting effective prompts that instruct Gemini on the desired output format (JSON is often best for structured data) and how to use the provided functions.
    *   Implementing the Go logic to parse Gemini's responses and handle the data (e.g., populating map markers, displaying text).
    *   Orchestrating multi-step interactions with Gemini if needed.
2.  Your Go backend will be the "brain" or "agent" that uses `go-genai` as its interface to the LLM's reasoning capabilities.
3.  You likely don't need to introduce the complexity of a separate agent framework or an MPC server at this stage.

This approach gives you a lot of power and control, keeps your stack cohesive (Go-centric), and is more than capable of delivering the personalized itinerary generation you're aiming for.

You're hitting on a very important point for creating truly useful and engaging AI experiences! Yes, for multi-turn dialogues ("Add more food stops," "Actually, I only have 2 hours now, can you adjust that?"), you need a layer of logic beyond just sending single prompts to `go-genai`. This layer effectively constitutes a simple "AI agent framework" that you can indeed build in Go.

**Yes, you can absolutely build an AI agent framework (or the necessary components for conversational flows) in Go.** Go is well-suited for this due to its performance, concurrency features, and strong typing, which helps in managing complex states.

Here's what you'd typically need and how you can approach building it in Go:

**Core Components of Your Go-Based "Agent" for Multi-Turn Dialogues:**

1.  **Session Management & State Tracking:**
    *   **What:** You need to identify and manage an ongoing conversation with a specific user. The "state" would be the current version of the itinerary, previous user queries, LLM responses, constraints mentioned, etc.
    *   **How in Go:**
        *   Assign a `session_id` to each conversation. This could be generated on the first interaction and passed back and forth between the client and server.
        *   Store the session state. Options:
            *   **In-memory (with TTL, e.g., using a `map[string]*SessionState` protected by a mutex, or a library like `go-cache`):** Good for short-lived sessions, very fast. Might be lost if the server restarts unless persisted.
            *   **Redis:** Excellent for distributed session storage, offers persistence, and fast access.
            *   **PostgreSQL (e.g., a `JSONB` column in your `llm_interactions` table or a dedicated `sessions` table):** More durable, allows complex querying of session history, but slightly higher latency than Redis. You could store the "current itinerary" as a JSONB object here.
        *   Your Go struct for `SessionState` might look like:
            ```go
            type ItineraryPOI struct {
                ID          string                 `json:"id"` // Your POI ID
                Name        string                 `json:"name"`
                Coordinates map[string]float64     `json:"coordinates"`
                Description string                 `json:"description,omitempty"`
                // ... other relevant POI details for the itinerary
            }

            type SessionState struct {
                UserID             string           `json:"user_id"`
                CurrentItinerary   []ItineraryPOI   `json:"current_itinerary"`
                OriginalPreferences map[string]any `json:"original_preferences"` // User interests, time, etc.
                AppliedConstraints map[string]any `json:"applied_constraints"`  // Constraints from the conversation
                ConversationHistory []Turn         `json:"conversation_history"`
                LastUpdatedAt      time.Time      `json:"last_updated_at"`
            }

            type Turn struct {
                Speaker   string    `json:"speaker"` // "user" or "ai"
                Text      string    `json:"text"`
                Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
            }
            ```

2.  **Conversation History Management:**
    *   **What:** Keep track of what the user and AI have said. This history is crucial context for the LLM in subsequent turns.
    *   **How in Go:** Append each user utterance and AI response to the `ConversationHistory` slice within your `SessionState`. When sending a new prompt to Gemini, you'll include relevant parts of this history.

3.  **Contextual Prompt Augmentation:**
    *   **What:** When the user provides a follow-up ("Add more food stops"), you don't just send that phrase to Gemini. You need to combine it with the existing context.
    *   **How in Go:**
        *   Retrieve the current `SessionState`.
        *   Construct a new prompt for `go-genai` that includes:
            *   The latest user utterance.
            *   A summary or key parts of the `ConversationHistory`.
            *   The `CurrentItinerary` (or a summary of it).
            *   The `AppliedConstraints`.
            *   An instruction to the LLM, e.g., "Given the previous conversation and the current itinerary, the user now wants to 'add more food stops'. Please update the itinerary or suggest food stops compatible with the current plan."

4.  **Intent Recognition & Action Dispatch (Can be LLM-driven or rule-based):**
    *   **What:** Figure out what the user *means* by their follow-up. "Add food stops" is different from "Make it shorter."
    *   **How in Go:**
        *   **Simple Rule-Based:** For a few common refinements, you might use string matching or simple NLP in Go. (e.g., if "food" or "restaurant" in query -> trigger food addition logic). This is brittle.
        *   **LLM for Intent Recognition (More Robust):** You can actually make a quick call to Gemini with the user's utterance and the current context, asking it to classify the intent and extract parameters. E.g., Prompt: "User said: 'Add some cheap lunch options near the museum'. Classify intent (ADD_POI, MODIFY_CONSTRAINT, CLARIFY) and extract entities (poi_type: restaurant, price: cheap, location_constraint: near museum)." Gemini can return this as JSON.
        *   **Action Dispatch:** Based on the recognized intent, your Go code decides what to do:
            *   Query your PostGIS database directly (e.g., for nearby restaurants if intent is "add food").
            *   Re-prompt Gemini with the augmented context to modify the itinerary.
            *   Call specific internal functions.

5.  **Tool/Function Orchestration (You're already planning this):**
    *   **What:** Gemini's function calling will still be vital. The LLM might decide it needs to "call a function" to find food places or check opening times to fulfill the user's new request.
    *   **How in Go:** Your Go backend still hosts these functions and executes them. The multi-turn framework provides the context for *why* these functions are being called.

6.  **Updating State and Generating Response:**
    *   **What:** After the LLM (or your internal logic) processes the refinement, the `SessionState` (especially `CurrentItinerary` and `AppliedConstraints`) must be updated.
    *   **How in Go:** Modify the `SessionState` struct and save it back to your chosen storage (Redis/Postgres). The final text response from Gemini (or a summary composed by your Go code) is sent to the user.

**Example Flow in Your Go "Agent":**

1.  **User (Turn 1):** "Plan a day in Berlin for me. I like history and art. I have about 6 hours."
    *   **Go Agent:**
        *   Creates a new session.
        *   Stores initial preferences.
        *   Constructs initial prompt for `go-genai`.
        *   `go-genai` (possibly using function calls to your DB for POIs) returns an itinerary (e.g., Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, Museum Island).
        *   Go Agent stores this as `CurrentItinerary` in `SessionState`, adds to `ConversationHistory`.
        *   Sends itinerary to user.

2.  **User (Turn 2):** "Okay, cool. Can you add a good place for traditional German lunch near Museum Island?"
    *   **Go Agent:**
        *   Retrieves `SessionState`.
        *   **Intent Recognition (Optional Step):** Determines intent = "add POI (restaurant)" with constraints "traditional German," "lunch," "near Museum Island."
        *   **Prompt Augmentation:** Creates prompt for `go-genai`: "Context: User is planning a 6hr Berlin trip (history/art). Current itinerary: [details of itinerary]. Previous turn: [...]. User now asks: 'Can you add a good place for traditional German lunch near Museum Island?'. Please suggest 1-2 suitable restaurants and integrate one into the itinerary if it fits, or use the `find_restaurants` function."
        *   `go-genai` might:
            *   Directly suggest restaurants.
            *   Or call a function `find_restaurants(area="Museum Island", cuisine="German", meal="lunch")` which your Go backend executes against PostGIS.
        *   Go Agent receives Gemini's updated plan/suggestions.
        *   Updates `CurrentItinerary` and `ConversationHistory` in `SessionState`.
        *   Sends updated itinerary/suggestions to user.

3.  **User (Turn 3):** "Actually, make the Museum Island part shorter, I only want to spend 1 hour there."
    *   **Go Agent:** Similar process – retrieve state, augment prompt with new constraint, call `go-genai` to revise the Museum Island segment of the `CurrentItinerary`, update state, respond.

**Building Blocks in Go:**

*   **HTTP Handlers:** Receive user requests, manage session IDs.
*   **Service Layer:** Contains the core conversational logic.
    *   `SessionService`: Manages loading/saving session state.
    *   `ItineraryService` (or `RecommendationService`): Handles the actual generation and modification of itineraries, orchestrating calls to `go-genai` and database services.
*   **Repository Layer:** Interacts with your database (Postgres for POIs, session state if stored there; Redis client if using Redis).
*   **`go-genai` Client:** Your interface to the Gemini API.

**Is there a "Go-LangChain"?**

*   The Go ecosystem for full-fledged LLM agent frameworks like Python's LangChain or LlamaIndex is still developing but growing.
*   You'll find Go SDKs for many LLMs (like `go-genai`) and vector databases.
*   You might not find a single Go library that does *everything* LangChain does out-of-the-box.
*   However, the core concepts (prompt templating, LLM calls, output parsing, tool use, simple memory) are things you can implement relatively straightforwardly in Go using `go-genai` as the LLM interaction component. You'd be building the "chaining" and "agentic" logic yourself, which gives you a lot of control and is very doable.

**Starting Point:**

Start simple. For your post-MVP, handle a few common refinement types. You don't need to build a universally flexible agent framework from day one. Iterate and add more conversational capabilities as you identify user needs. Your Go backend, armed with `go-genai` and good state management, is a powerful foundation.

## Answer to Your Query

You're working on an exciting project with WanderWiseAI, where you want to use AI to generate personalized city itineraries based on user interests and preferences, displayed on a map with points of interest (POIs) and accompanied by detailed text descriptions (including history and other details). You're considering using the `go-genai` SDK from Google to interact with their Gemini models, and you're wondering how to efficiently handle and store the potentially large amounts of AI-generated text in your PostgreSQL database. You're also questioning whether `go-genai` is sufficient for this task or if you should consider alternatives like an MPC server or a dedicated AI agent. Let’s break this down step-by-step and provide a clear, actionable answer.

### Understanding Your Requirements

Your application has two primary outputs for each itinerary:

1.  **Map Display:** Requires coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each POI to plot them visually.
2.  **Text Descriptions:** Detailed AI-generated content for each POI, including history and other relevant information, to be shown alongside the map.

You’ve already designed a database schema with tables like `llm_interactions`, `cities`, and `points_of_interest`, which is a great starting point. The challenge you’ve identified is managing the large volume of text generated by the AI, ensuring it’s stored efficiently, and retrieved appropriately for both map and text views.

Your question about `go-genai` versus other options (MPC server or AI agent) hinges on whether it can meet your needs for text generation, data integration, and scalability. Let’s address this systematically.

### Proposed Solution: Database Structure

To handle the itinerary data efficiently, you’ll need to extend your schema to store itineraries and their associated POIs. Here’s a refined approach based on your requirements:

#### Database Schema

```sql
-- Table to store user itineraries
CREATE TABLE itineraries (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    city_id UUID REFERENCES cities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Table to link POIs to itineraries with AI-generated descriptions
CREATE TABLE itinerary_pois (
    itinerary_id UUID REFERENCES itineraries(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    poi_id UUID REFERENCES points_of_interest(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    order_index INTEGER NOT NULL, -- To maintain the sequence of POIs in the itinerary
    ai_description TEXT,          -- AI-generated description specific to this POI in this itinerary
    PRIMARY KEY (itinerary_id, poi_id)
);
```

*   **`itineraries` Table:** Stores metadata about each itinerary, linking it to a user and a city.
*   **`itinerary_pois` Table:** Connects POIs to itineraries, storing the AI-generated description for each POI and an `order_index` to preserve the sequence for display on the map and in text.

#### How It Works

*   **Coordinates for Map:** The `location` column in your `points_of_interest` table (a `GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)` type) already provides the coordinates needed for mapping. You can query this via the `itinerary_pois` table by joining with `points_of_interest` to get the POIs and their locations for a given itinerary.
*   **Text Descriptions:** The `ai_description` column in `itinerary_pois` stores the detailed, AI-generated text for each POI specific to that itinerary. This keeps the text tied to the context of the user’s preferences and the itinerary itself.

This structure separates the core POI data (in `points_of_interest`) from the personalized, AI-generated content (in `itinerary_pois`), allowing flexibility and efficient retrieval.

### Using `go-genai` for AI Integration

The `go-genai` SDK allows your Go backend to interact with Google’s Gemini models, which are well-suited for generating the text you need. Here’s how it fits into your project:

#### Capabilities of `go-genai`

*   **Text Generation:** Gemini models excel at producing coherent, contextually relevant text. You can use them to generate detailed descriptions for each POI based on user preferences (e.g., “User loves history—give me a historical summary of the Eiffel Tower”).
*   **Function Calling:** If you need the AI to fetch specific data (e.g., a list of POIs from your database), you can define functions in your Go code (e.g., `findPOIsNearLocation`) and let Gemini request these via function calls. This integrates AI with your database seamlessly.
*   **Ease of Use:** Since your backend is in Go, `go-genai` integrates naturally, avoiding the need for additional languages or frameworks.

#### Example Workflow

1.  **User Request:** A user specifies their interests (e.g., “history, food”) and a city (e.g., “Paris”).
2.  **Prompt Construction:** Your backend builds a prompt like: “Generate a one-day itinerary for Paris for a user interested in history and food, including 5 POIs with detailed descriptions.”
3.  **AI Response:** Gemini generates a response, which might include a list of POIs and text descriptions. If it needs database data (e.g., POI coordinates), it triggers a function call.
4.  **Backend Processing:** Your Go code executes the function (e.g., queries `points_of_interest` for POIs in Paris), sends the results back to Gemini, and receives the final itinerary.
5.  **Storage:** The itinerary is saved in the `itineraries` and `itinerary_pois` tables, with coordinates from `points_of_interest` and AI text in `ai_description`.

#### Sample Go Code

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "strings"
    "github.com/googleapis/go-genai" // Assuming this is the correct import path, adjust if necessary
    "github.com/google/uuid"
)

// Assuming genai.NewClient requires an API key; in a real app, this would be managed securely.
// Also, the actual Gemini client might be initialized differently (e.g., with options from google.golang.org/api/option).
// This is a simplified representation.
/*
func generateItinerary(ctx context.Context, userID uuid.UUID, cityID uuid.UUID, preferences []string) (string, error) {
    // The actual client initialization would likely involve service account credentials or API keys
    // This is a placeholder for conceptual understanding
    // client, err := genai.NewGenerativeModel(ctx, genai.WithModel("gemini-pro")) // Example of possible initialization
    // if err != nil {
    //     return "", err
    // }
    // Placeholder for client initialization
    var client *genai.GenerativeModel // Use the correct type from go-genai

    prompt := fmt.Sprintf("Generate a personalized itinerary for a user interested in %s in the city with ID %s.", strings.Join(preferences, ", "), cityID)
    
    // The actual call to generate text might look different.
    // Refer to go-genai documentation for exact method signatures.
    // For instance, it might be client.GenerateContent(ctx, ...)
    // resp, err := client.GenerateText(ctx, &genai.GenerateTextRequest{ Prompt: prompt, }) // This might be from an older or different SDK

    // Example based on typical go-genai usage:
    // model := client.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro") // Or your preferred model
    // resp, err := model.GenerateContent(ctx, genai.Text(prompt))
    // if err != nil {
    //     return "", err
    // }

    // This is highly dependent on the actual go-genai SDK structure.
    // The original example's client.GenerateText and resp.Text might not be accurate.
    // Assuming a simplified response structure for the example:
    // return resp.Text, nil
    return "Generated itinerary text based on prompt: " + prompt, nil // Placeholder return
}
*/
```
*(Note: The Go code snippet above was commented out and adjusted as the original `genai.NewClient` and `client.GenerateText` might not directly map to the current `google/generative-ai-go` SDK's exact API. The user should refer to the official `go-genai` documentation for accurate client initialization and text generation methods. The conceptual flow is what's important here.)*

### Handling Large Amounts of Text

You’re right to be concerned about the volume of text generated by the AI. Here’s how to manage it:

*   **Storage:**
    *   Store the AI-generated descriptions in the `ai_description` column of `itinerary_pois`. This ensures each POI’s text is linked to the specific itinerary, avoiding regeneration.
    *   Use PostgreSQL’s `TEXT` type, which has no practical length limit, making it suitable for long descriptions.
*   **Retrieval:**
    *   For the map view, query only the `poi_id` and join with `points_of_interest` to get `location` (coordinates), ignoring `ai_description` unless needed.
    *   For the text view, fetch the `ai_description` alongside the POI details when displaying the itinerary.
*   **Optimization:**
    *   **Chunking/Streaming:** If the AI generates very long responses, use `go-genai`’s streaming capabilities (if available for the chosen model interaction method) to process text in chunks, saving it incrementally.
    *   **Summarization:** Ask Gemini to provide a short summary alongside the full description, storing both (e.g., in separate columns or as a JSONB object).
    *   **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed itineraries in memory (e.g., using Redis) to reduce database load.

### Is `go-genai` Enough, or Do You Need an MPC Server or AI Agent?

Let’s evaluate your options:

#### Why `go-genai` Is Likely Sufficient

*   **Text Generation Needs:** Your primary task is generating itineraries and POI descriptions, which Gemini models handle well via `go-genai`.
*   **Database Integration:** Function calling allows Gemini to request data from your PostgreSQL database (e.g., POI lists), which your Go backend can execute and feed back to the AI.
*   **Simplicity:** Using `go-genai` keeps your stack lean, avoiding the overhead of additional servers or frameworks.
*   **Scalability:** For most use cases, the Gemini API (via `go-genai`) can handle the load, and your backend can scale independently with Go’s performance.

#### When to Consider Alternatives

*   **Complex Conversational Flows:** If you want a multi-turn dialogue (e.g., “Add more food stops,” “Shorten the itinerary”), a dedicated AI agent framework might better manage state and context. `go-genai` can handle single prompts well but isn’t designed for ongoing conversations without additional logic.
*   **Custom Model Training:** If you need to fine-tune the AI on your specific data (e.g., user reviews or niche POIs), `go-genai` doesn’t support this—you’d need a custom model and infrastructure.
*   **High Traffic/Optimization:** For massive scale, an MPC (Multi-Party Computation) server could distribute AI inference, but this is overkill unless you expect millions of concurrent users.
*   **Privacy:** If sensitive data requires secure computation, MPC might be relevant, but this isn’t typical for a travel app.

### Recommendation

For your described use case—generating personalized itineraries with map coordinates and text descriptions—`go-genai` is sufficient. It provides the text generation power you need, integrates with your Go backend, and supports function calls for database interaction. Unless you anticipate needing complex dialogues, custom training, or extreme scalability right away, stick with `go-genai` to keep your project straightforward and maintainable.

### Final Thoughts

Here’s a concise plan to move forward:

1.  **Database:** Implement the `itineraries` and `itinerary_pois` tables as shown. Store coordinates in `points_of_interest` and AI text in `itinerary_pois`.
2.  **AI Integration:** Use `go-genai` to generate itineraries, parsing the output to extract POIs and descriptions. Save these to the database for reuse.
3.  **Frontend:** Fetch coordinates for the map and text for the details view separately, optimizing queries based on need.
4.  **Text Management:** Use streaming or summarization if text volume becomes an issue, and cache popular itineraries.

With this setup, `go-genai` will meet your needs efficiently, and your PostgreSQL schema will handle the data robustly. Start with this approach, and revisit alternatives only if your requirements evolve significantly (e.g., toward conversational AI or massive scale).

Good luck with WanderWiseAI—it’s a fantastic idea with a lot of potential! Let me know if you need help refining any part of this further.

## Answer to Your Query

You’re looking to implement multi-turn dialogue capabilities for WanderWiseAI post-MVP, allowing users to interactively refine their itineraries with requests like “Add more food stops” or “Shorten the itinerary.” You’ve asked what’s needed to achieve this and whether you can build an AI agent framework using Go. Let’s dive in and provide a clear, actionable answer!

### What Is Multi-Turn Dialogue?

Multi-turn dialogue means the AI can maintain an ongoing conversation, understanding follow-up requests based on prior exchanges. Unlike single-turn prompts (e.g., “Generate an itinerary”), it requires the AI to remember context—like the current itinerary and past user inputs—and respond dynamically. Since `go-genai` is designed for single prompts (or more accurately, managing individual calls to the Gemini API which are stateless by default from the API's perspective), you’ll need to add logic to manage state and context for ongoing conversations.

### What You’ll Need for Multi-Turn Dialogue

To enable multi-turn dialogue in WanderWiseAI, you’ll need the following components:

1.  **Context Management:** Store and retrieve the conversation history and itinerary details.
2.  **State Tracking:** Keep track of the current itinerary and user preferences across interactions.
3.  **Dynamic Responses:** Generate AI replies that reflect both the latest request and prior context.
4.  **Database Integration:** Update the itinerary in your database based on user inputs and AI suggestions.
5.  **Real-Time Interaction:** Handle user messages and AI responses seamlessly, possibly in real time.

### Can You Build an AI Agent Framework with Go?

Yes, absolutely! You can build a custom AI agent framework (or the necessary components for it) in Go to manage multi-turn dialogues. Go’s performance, concurrency support, and your existing use of `go-genai` make it a great fit. Here’s how to do it:

#### Key Components of the Framework

##### Conversation State Management

Store conversation history in a database to maintain context.
Example schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    itinerary_id UUID REFERENCES itineraries(id), -- Or maybe just session_id if itinerary is dynamic
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE conversation_messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id),
    role TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'user' or 'assistant' (or 'model' depending on Gemini API terminology)
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
This tracks each message, linking it to a user and itinerary (or session).

##### Contextual Prompting

For each user message, build a prompt that includes:
*   The current itinerary (e.g., “Visiting Paris: Eiffel Tower, Louvre”).
*   Recent conversation history (e.g., “User: Add more food stops. Assistant: Added Café XYZ.”).
*   The new request (e.g., “Shorten the itinerary”).

Example:

```
Current Itinerary: Paris - Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Café XYZ
Conversation History:
User: Add more food stops.
Assistant: Added Le Bistro.
Latest User Request: Shorten the itinerary.
```

##### AI Integration with `go-genai`

*   Send the constructed prompt (often including the history as distinct messages in the API call if using a chat model like Gemini) to the Gemini model via `go-genai`.
*   Parse the response to get the updated itinerary or instructions.
*   Optionally, use function calling to trigger database updates (e.g., adding a food stop).

##### Database Updates

*   After the AI responds, update your `itineraries` and `itinerary_pois` tables as needed.
*   For example, if the AI suggests a new food stop, insert it into `itinerary_pois`.

##### User Interaction Handling

*   Use WebSockets or long-polling for real-time dialogue.
*   Process user inputs, get AI responses, and send them back to the user.

#### Sample Go Code

Here’s a basic conceptual example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    // "database/sql" // For database interaction
    "github.com/google/generative-ai-go/genai" // Correct import for go-genai
    "google.golang.org/api/option"             // For API key or credentials
    "github.com/google/uuid"
    // "log"
)

type ConversationManager struct {
    model *genai.GenerativeModel
    // db *sql.DB // Your database connection
}

// NewConversationManager is a constructor for ConversationManager
func NewConversationManager(ctx context.Context, apiKey string /*, db *sql.DB*/) (*ConversationManager, error) {
    client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, option.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create genai client: %w", err)
    }
    model := client.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro") // Or your preferred model
    // return &ConversationManager{model: model, db: db}, nil
    return &ConversationManager{model: model}, nil
}

func (cm *ConversationManager) HandleUserMessage(ctx context.Context, conversationID uuid.UUID, userMessage string) (string, error) {
    // 1. Fetch conversation history and current itinerary from DB based on conversationID
    history, err := cm.getConversationHistory(ctx, conversationID) // Implement this
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to get conversation history: %w", err)
    }
    currentItinerary, err := cm.getItinerary(ctx, conversationID) // Implement this
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to get itinerary: %w", err)
    }

    // 2. Build the prompt for the Gemini model
    // For chat models, you'd construct a series of genai.Content parts
    chatSession := cm.model.StartChat() // Start a chat session
    
    // Add history to chat session
    // This is a simplified way; you'd iterate through your stored messages
    for _, msg := range history { // Assuming history is a slice of stored messages
        // You'll need to map your stored 'role' to what genai.Content expects for 'Role'
        // e.g., if msg.Role == "user", then role = "user"; if msg.Role == "assistant", then role = "model"
        // chatSession.History = append(chatSession.History, &genai.Content{Role: msg.Role, Parts: []genai.Part{genai.Text(msg.Content)}})
    }
    // Add current itinerary context if not part of explicit history
    // This might be a system prompt or part of the user's first message in this turn.
    // For simplicity, let's assume it's prepended or Gemini infers from history.

    // The new user message
    promptParts := []genai.Part{
        genai.Text(fmt.Sprintf("Current Itinerary Context: %s\nUser's new request: %s", currentItinerary, userMessage)),
    }

    // 3. Call the AI
    resp, err := chatSession.SendMessage(ctx, promptParts...)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to send message to Gemini: %w", err)
    }

    // 4. Extract the assistant's response text
    var assistantResponseText string
    for _, cand := range resp.Candidates {
        if cand.Content != nil {
            for _, part := range cand.Content.Parts {
                if txt, ok := part.(genai.Text); ok {
                    assistantResponseText += string(txt)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    if assistantResponseText == "" {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("received an empty response from AI")
    }


    // 5. Save the user's message and the assistant's response to DB
    err = cm.saveMessage(ctx, conversationID, "user", userMessage) // Implement this
    if err != nil {
        // Log error, but might proceed with returning AI response
        fmt.Printf("Error saving user message: %v\n", err)
    }
    err = cm.saveMessage(ctx, conversationID, "assistant", assistantResponseText) // Implement this
    if err != nil {
        // Log error
        fmt.Printf("Error saving assistant message: %v\n", err)
    }
    
    // 6. Update itinerary in the database based on assistantResponseText (add your logic here)
    // This might involve parsing assistantResponseText or using function calls if designed that way.

    return assistantResponseText, nil

```
*(Note: The Go code snippet above has been updated to align more closely with the `google/generative-ai-go/genai` SDK's chat model interactions and includes a conceptual `main` function. Implementations for database interactions (`getConversationHistory`, `getItinerary`, `saveMessage`) are placeholders and need to be fully developed.)*

#### Step-by-Step Plan

1.  **Set Up the Database:**
    *   Add tables for `conversations` and `conversation_messages` to store dialogue history.
2.  **Manage Context:**
    *   Fetch conversation history and current itinerary details to build comprehensive prompts.
3.  **Integrate AI:**
    *   Use `go-genai` (specifically chat sessions if appropriate) to process contextual prompts and handle responses.
4.  **Enable Real-Time Interaction (Optional but good UX):**
    *   Implement WebSockets or a similar mechanism for a smooth, chat-like user experience.
5.  **Test and Iterate:**
    *   Start with simple commands (e.g., “Add a stop,” “Remove a stop”) and expand to more complex conversational flows.

#### Alternatives to Consider

While a custom Go solution works well, here are other options:

*   **LangChain:** Great for AI agents and complex chains, but it’s primarily Python-based. Integrating a Python LangChain service with your Go backend would introduce cross-language communication.
*   **Dialogflow / Vertex AI Conversation:** These are Google Cloud's managed platforms for building conversational AI. They handle a lot of the state management and NLU but might be less flexible for very custom itinerary logic tied deeply to your database.

**Recommendation:** Stick with a custom Go framework for multi-turn dialogue in WanderWiseAI. This approach offers consistency with your existing stack, gives you fine-grained control over the logic and database interactions, and leverages Go's performance.

### Conclusion

You can definitely build an AI agent framework (or the necessary conversational management components) in Go for multi-turn dialogue in WanderWiseAI. By managing conversation state effectively, constructing contextual prompts for `go-genai`, and updating your database dynamically, you’ll create a highly interactive and personalized experience for your users. Start with the core components outlined above, test thoroughly, and iterate based on user feedback and your evolving feature set. Happy coding!
