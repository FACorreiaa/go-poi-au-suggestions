# WanderWiseAI Frontend and Map Library Decision

## Step 1: Choosing a Map Library

Before selecting a frontend framework, we need a map library that meets your requirements:

- **Display points on a map**: Plotting POIs as markers or symbols.
- **Connect points with lines**: Visualizing an itinerary with polylines or paths.
- **Clickable properties**: Interactive markers or popups with event handling.
- **Good performance**: Handling potentially large datasets from your AI-generated results.

### Top Contenders

- **Leaflet**: Lightweight, open-source, and widely used. Supports markers, polylines, and popups out of the box.
- **Mapbox GL JS**: A powerful, modern library with vector tiles, 3D capabilities, and smooth performance. Supports animated lines and clickable markers.
- **OpenLayers**: Feature-rich but heavier than Leaflet.
- **Google Maps**: Popular but less customizable and incurs usage costs.

### Recommendation

**Mapbox GL JS** stands out:

- Excels at rendering points, drawing animated lines, and handling interactivity.
- Smooth performance with large datasets.
- Polished, modern look with great animation support.

---

## Step 2: Frontend Framework Evaluation

Choosing between **SvelteKit**, **Angular**, and **React**.

We evaluate based on:

- Map library integration.
- Animation libraries.
- Performance and developer experience.

---

### SvelteKit

**Map Integration**:

- Libraries like `svelte-mapbox`.
- Direct use of Mapbox GL JS with lifecycle functions like `onMount`.
- Leaflet integration via `svelte-leaflet`.

**Animation Libraries**:

- Built-in transitions (e.g., `transition:fade`, `transition:slide`).
- Additional libraries like `svelte-motion` available.

```svelte
{#each points as point}
  <Marker lat={point.lat} lng={point.lng} transition:fade />
{/each}
```

**Pros**:

- Compiles to vanilla JS ‚Üí smaller bundles, faster load times.
- Simple reactive syntax.
- Built-in stores and Vite-powered development.

**Cons**:

- Smaller ecosystem (but growing fast).

---

### Angular

**Map Integration**:

- Libraries like `ngx-mapbox-gl`.
- Angular-Leaflet integrations exist.

**Animation Libraries**:

- Powerful but complex animation module.

```typescript
@Component({
  animations: [
    trigger('fade', [
      transition(':enter', [
        style({ opacity: 0 }),
        animate('300ms', style({ opacity: 1 }))
      ])
    ])
  ]
})
```

**Pros**:

- Full-featured with CLI and RxJS.
- Strong TypeScript support.

**Cons**:

- Larger bundles.
- Steeper learning curve.
- Overkill for focused, map-centric apps.

---

### React

**Map Integration**:

- `react-map-gl` for Mapbox GL JS.
- `react-leaflet` for Leaflet.

```jsx
import Map from 'react-map-gl';

<Map mapboxAccessToken="your-token">
  {points.map(point => (
    <Marker key={point.id} latitude={point.lat} longitude={point.lng} />
  ))}
</Map>
```

**Animation Libraries**:

- Great options like Framer Motion, React Spring, React Transition Group.

```jsx
<motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>
  {point.name}
</motion.div>
```

**Pros**:

- Vast ecosystem.
- Familiar component-based architecture.

**Cons**:

- Larger bundles compared to SvelteKit.
- Slightly more setup for animations.

## Step 3: Comparing the Frameworks

| Criteria            | SvelteKit                    | Angular                     | React                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Map Integration     | Seamless with Mapbox/Leaflet   | Robust but heavier setup     | Seamless with popular libs |
| Animation Capabilities | Built-in and lightweight    | Powerful but complex         | Flexible with libraries    |
| Performance         | Smallest bundles, fastest     | Heaviest runtime             | Moderate, optimizable      |
| Developer Experience | Intuitive, minimal boilerplate | Steep learning curve         | Familiar, verbose setup    |

---

## Step 4: Recommendation

### **Recommended Stack: SvelteKit + Mapbox GL JS**

### Why?

- **Map Functionality**: Easy POI rendering, animated itinerary lines, clickable popups.
- **Animations**: Built-in, performant transitions (e.g., fading markers, sliding panels).
- **Performance**: SvelteKit‚Äôs tiny bundles + Mapbox GL JS = fast mobile experience.
- **Simplicity**: Reactive, intuitive code to manage dynamic, AI-generated map data.

---

## Example Workflow (SvelteKit + Mapbox GL JS)

**Backend**:

- AI generates POI data via PostGIS/pgvector.
- Served through your Go API.

**Frontend**:

Fetch POIs and render markers:

```svelte
<script>
  import { Map, Marker, Popup } from 'svelte-mapbox';
  let points = []; // Fetched from API
  let selectedPoint = null;
</script>

<Map accessToken="your-token">
  {#each points as point}
    <Marker lat={point.lat} lng={point.lng} on:click={() => selectedPoint = point} />
    {#if selectedPoint === point}
      <Popup lat={point.lat} lng={point.lng}>
        <div transition:fade>{point.name}</div>
      </Popup>
    {/if}
  {/each}
</Map>
```

Draw an itinerary line:

- Use Mapbox‚Äôs GeoJSON layer and animate it.

Enhance UI:

- Svelte transitions for animating marker appearance, itinerary updates, etc.

---

## Alternatives

- **React**: A strong runner-up. Choose if you prefer a large ecosystem or are very comfortable with React.
- **Angular**: Best for enterprise-grade apps; heavier for focused apps like WanderWiseAI.

---

## Final Thoughts

**SvelteKit + Mapbox GL JS** gives you a lean, performant, and visually stunning solution for your city exploration app.

- Map display ‚úîÔ∏è
- Itinerary visualization ‚úîÔ∏è
- Interactivity ‚úîÔ∏è
- Animations ‚úîÔ∏è
- Mobile-first experience ‚úîÔ∏è

Start with this stack to build a robust MVP and scale it beautifully as you grow!
