## Database Design & Vector Search

### PostgreSQL with Extensions
The database architecture leverages multiple PostgreSQL extensions:

**Extensions Used:**
- **PostGIS** for geospatial data and location-based queries
- **pgvector** for vector similarity search and embeddings
- **uuid-ossp** for UUID generation

**Schema Design:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE points_of_interest (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    location GEOMETRY(Point, 4326) NOT NULL,
    city_id UUID REFERENCES cities(id),
    address TEXT,
    poi_type TEXT,
    website TEXT,
    phone_number TEXT,
    opening_hours JSONB,
    price_level INTEGER CHECK (price_level >= 1 AND price_level <= 4),
    average_rating NUMERIC(3, 2),
    rating_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    source poi_source NOT NULL DEFAULT 'loci_ai',
    source_id TEXT,
    is_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_sponsored BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    ai_summary TEXT,
    embedding VECTOR(768),
    tags TEXT[],
    accessibility_info TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Vector Search Implementation:**
- 768-dimensional embeddings using Google's text-embedding-004 model
- Cosine similarity search with `embedding <=> $1` operator
- Optimized indexing with HNSW or IVFFlat indexes
- Integration with Google Generative AI for embedding generation

## Embeddings and RAG Implementation

### Using pgvector for Embeddings and Google Generative AI Gemini SDK

The integration of pgvector for embeddings and the Google Generative AI Gemini SDK enables sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities that significantly enhance the process of saving and leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) responses.

### How Embeddings Help Save LLM Responses

Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. By combining pgvector with the Gemini SDK, the system can store LLM responses as embeddings and utilize them for various purposes:

#### 1. Efficient Retrieval for RAG
In RAG systems, embeddings allow storage of LLM-generated responses alongside their prompts or context in a vector database. When a similar query is made, relevant past responses can be retrieved instead of regenerating them, reducing latency and computational cost.

**Example:** If a user asks "What is the capital of France?" and the LLM responds "The capital of France is Paris," both the prompt and response are stored as embeddings. Later, a similar query like "France's capital?" can retrieve the stored response based on semantic similarity.

#### 2. Caching Responses
Storing embeddings of prompts and their corresponding LLM responses enables intelligent caching. If a new query's embedding is close to a stored prompt's embedding (based on cosine similarity), the cached response can be returned instead of querying the LLM again, saving API costs and improving response time.

#### 3. Contextual Memory for Conversations
LLMs like Gemini lack inherent state or memory. By storing embeddings of conversation history (prompts and responses) in pgvector, relevant past interactions can be retrieved to provide context for new queries, simulating long-term memory.

#### 4. Semantic Search and Analysis
Embeddings enable semantic search over stored LLM responses, allowing discovery of responses that are conceptually similar to a query, even if the wording differs. This is valuable for applications like Q&A bots or recommendation systems.

#### 5. Reducing Redundant Computations
For applications that frequently receive similar queries, storing embeddings of prompts and responses prevents redundant LLM calls, especially important since Gemini API calls incur costs ($0.075–$21 per million tokens, depending on the model).

### Implementation Architecture

#### Repository Layer
```go
type POIRepo interface {
    FindSimilarPOIs(ctx context.Context, queryEmbedding []float32, limit int) ([]poi.POI, error)
}

func (r *PostgresPOIRepo) FindSimilarPOIs(ctx context.Context, queryEmbedding []float32, limit int) ([]poi.POI, error) {
    vectorParam := pgvector.NewVector(queryEmbedding)
    query := `
        SELECT id, name, description
        FROM points_of_interest
        ORDER BY embedding <=> $1
        LIMIT $2`
    // Implementation details...
}
```

#### Service Layer
```go
type RecommendationService struct {
    genaiClient *genai.Client
    poiRepo     postgres.POIRepo
}

func (s *RecommendationService) GetEmbedding(ctx context.Context, textToEmbed string) ([]float32, error) {
    em := s.genaiClient.EmbeddingModel("text-embedding-004")
    res, err := em.EmbedContent(ctx, genai.Text(textToEmbed))
    return res.Embedding.Values, nil
}

func (s *RecommendationService) FindSimilarPlaces(ctx context.Context, queryText string, limit int) ([]poi.POI, error) {
    queryEmbedding, err := s.GetEmbedding(ctx, queryText)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return s.poiRepo.FindSimilarPOIs(ctx, queryEmbedding, limit)
}
```

### Benefits of This Approach

**Cost Efficiency:** Reduces API calls by reusing cached responses for similar queries, saving on Gemini API costs.

**Speed:** Similarity search in pgvector is faster than generating new LLM responses, especially with proper indexing.

**Scalability:** pgvector and PostgreSQL provide a robust, scalable backend for storing and querying embeddings.

**Flexibility:** Supports semantic search, RAG, and conversational memory, enabling a wide range of applications.

### Considerations

**Embedding Dimensions:** Ensure consistency in embedding dimensions (768 for text-embedding-004, 3072 for gemini-embedding-001) between generation and storage.

**Token Limits:** Gemini embedding models have input limits (20,000 tokens for gemini-embedding-001, 1,500 requests per minute for text-embedding-004).

**Error Handling:** Handle potential errors such as connection issues with PostgreSQL or invalid API keys.

**Cost Management:** Monitor costs for Gemini API usage and database operations.

### Implementation in Current Services

The RAG functionality should be implemented in both the generative AI service and chat service to enable:

1. **Semantic POI Discovery** - Find relevant points of interest based on natural language queries
2. **Conversation Context** - Maintain conversation history for better recommendations
3. **Response Caching** - Store and retrieve similar responses to reduce API calls
4. **Personalized Recommendations** - Use stored user preferences and past interactions

### Testing Strategy

All LLM routes should be tested with RAG implementation:
- `/prompt-response/chat/sessions/{profileID}`
- `/prompt-response/chat/sessions/stream/{profileID}`
- `/prompt-response/profile/{profileID}`
- `/prompt-response/poi/details`
- `/prompt-response/poi/nearby`
- Hotel and restaurant recommendation endpoints

This comprehensive RAG implementation will significantly enhance the application's ability to provide relevant, contextual, and cost-effective AI-powered recommendations while maintaining conversation context and reducing redundant API calls.
